### Optional
The following steps are **not required** but might be handy for debugging
1) You can log into the database by first entering the docker container's shell
    ```sh
    docker exec -it <db container id or name> /bin/sh
    ```

1) Then executing the following to log into mariadb server
    ```sh
    mariadb -u root -p<password>
    ```

> Note: Make sure to replace '< password >' and '< db container id or name >' with appropriate values
